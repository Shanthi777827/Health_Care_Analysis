# üè• Healthcare SQL Analysis

##  Overview
This project performs **exploratory and operational analysis** on a simulated healthcare database using SQL.  
It covers patient demographics, appointment management, treatment analysis, and billing insights.

## Dataset
- patients
- doctors
- appointments
- treatments
- billing

##  Objectives
- Track patient visits and demographics
- Measure appointment performance (completed, cancelled, no-show)
- Identify top-performing doctors and treatments
- Analyze financial data from billing

##  SQL Skills Used
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`)
- Joins (`LEFT JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`)
- Grouping and filtering
- Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `LAG`)
- CTEs
- Date functions (`DATEDIFF`, `TIMESTAMPDIFF`)

##  Key Queries
- Unique patient count
- No-show rate KPI
- Peak appointment hours
- Top 5 doctors by revenue
- Patients treated but not billed
- Gap between patient visits

##  Conclusion
The analysis provides actionable insights for:
- Improving scheduling efficiency
- Enhancing doctor allocation
- Reducing missed billings
- Optimizing treatment resource planning
